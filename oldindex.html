                Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at Itron developing full stack applications in C#, C++, and Python for constructing and testing electronic devices.
                Before this, I graduated with a Computer Science degree from Clemson University, held SWE interships with Knack Works and Boeing, and was an undergraduate 
                machine learning researcher.

                When it comes to my technical skills. I'm experienced in C#, C++, and Python along with JavaScript, React, and VueJS. 
                I've come in contact with a lot of other programming languages, but I'll learn anything needed for a job.
                My free time is spent on statistics and machine learning projects, usually sports related, and the daily leetcode!
            </p>

                In Summer 2024, I'll be looking for full-time software engineering roles. Ideally I would prefer to be working remotely, in New York City, or Washington, D.C.. 
                I am not particular about the tech stack used on the job; I'm confident I can learn any tech stack fairly quickly. The most important thing to me 
                is working with a good team of people and having the opportunity to learn and grow; both as a developer and as a person.
