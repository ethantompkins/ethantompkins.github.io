<p>I currently work as a Software Engineer at Itron Inc.  I maintain this website primarily as an outlet for personal and professional research, with a focus on applied math and statistics. </p>

<p>I recently finished a tour as an assistant professor in the <a href="http://www.usma.edu/math">Department of Mathematics</a> at the <a href="http://www.usma.edu">U.S. Military Academy</a> (West Point), where I taught multivariable calculus.  I did my graduate (master's) program in the <a href="http://orc.mit.edu">Operations Research Center</a> at MIT, where I did research in complex networks with MIT's <a href="http://humnet.mit.edu">HuMNet Lab</a> and the <a href="http://www.draper.com">Draper Laboratory</a>.  You can read more about my ongoing research <a href="https://stmorse.github.io/research.html">here</a>.</p>
