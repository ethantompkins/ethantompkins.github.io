			<h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at Itron developing full stack applications in C#, C++, and Python for constructing and testing electronic devices.
                Before this, I graduated with a Computer Science degree from Clemson University, held SWE interships with Knack Works and Boeing, and was an undergraduate 
                machine learning researcher.
            </p>
            <p>
                When it comes to my technical skills. I'm experienced in C#, C++, and Python along with JavaScript, React, and VueJS. 
                I've come in contact with a lot of other programming languages, but I'll learn anything needed for a job.
                My free time is spent on statistics and machine learning projects, usually sports related, and the daily leetcode!
            </p>
            <p>
                In Summer 2024, I'll be looking for full-time software engineering roles. Ideally I would prefer to be working remotely, in New York City, or Washington, D.C.. 
                I am not particular about the tech stack used on the job; I'm confident I can learn any tech stack fairly quickly. The most important thing to me 
                is working with a good team of people and having the opportunity to learn and grow; both as a developer and as a person.
            </p>
