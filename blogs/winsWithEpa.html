                Exploring Wins based on Season EPA Metrics
            </h2>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium">Exploring Wins with nflfastR</h2>


<h3 class="text-xl font-medium" id="loading-libraries-and-data">Loading Libraries and Data</h3>

<p>First, let's load the libraries and get the play-by-play data for the last few NFL seasons. We'll use nflfastR to download the data and then transform it into a format that can be used for our analysis.</p>

<pre><code class="lang-r">library(nflfastR)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)

# Load play-by-play data from the 2018-2023 seasons
pbp_data &lt;- load_pbp(2018:2023)</code></pre>

<p>Using nflfastR's <code>load_pbp()</code> function, we loaded the data from the 2018 to 2023 seasons. This data is crucial for understanding the key metrics associated with wins.</p>

<br>
<h3 class="text-xl font-medium" id="transforming-the-data">Transforming the Data</h3>

<p>To explore what leads to a win, we need to create a dataset that summarizes key metrics per game. We’ll group the play-by-play data by game and team, then calculate metrics such as total yards, turnovers, and the success rate of passing and rushing plays.</p>

<pre><code class="lang-r"># Transform the data to calculate metrics for each game
team_summary &lt;- pbp_data %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(posteam)) %&gt;%
  group_by(game_id, season, week, home_team, away_team, posteam, result) %&gt;%
  summarise(
    total_yards = sum(yards_gained, na.rm = TRUE),
    turnovers = sum(interception + fumble_lost, na.rm = TRUE),
    pass_success_rate = mean(pass == 1 &amp; success == 1, na.rm = TRUE),
    rush_success_rate = mean(rush == 1 &amp; success == 1, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = 'drop'
  )</code></pre>

<p>In the above code, we calculated some common metrics for each team in each game, such as total yards, number of turnovers, and success rates for passing and rushing plays. We used the <code>group_by()</code> function to aggregate data by game, and <code>summarise()</code> to calculate these metrics.</p>

<br>
<h3 class="text-xl font-medium" id="visualizing-metrics-and-wins">Visualizing Metrics and Wins</h3>

<p>Next, we want to visualize how these metrics relate to wins. Let’s create some visualizations to better understand how factors like turnovers and total yards gained influence winning outcomes.</p>

<pre><code class="lang-r"># Create a win indicator
team_summary &lt;- team_summary %&gt;%
  mutate(win = ifelse(result &gt; 0, 1, 0))

# Visualize relationship between turnovers and winning percentage
ggplot(team_summary, aes(x = turnovers, y = win)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0.05, alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "glm", method.args = list(family = "binomial"), se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Relationship Between Turnovers and Winning Percentage",
       x = "Number of Turnovers",
       y = "Winning Percentage")</code></pre>

<p>Here, we used a logistic regression model to show how the probability of winning changes as the number of turnovers increases. As expected, the more turnovers a team commits, the lower their chances of winning.</p>

<br>
<h3 class="text-xl font-medium" id="total-yards-vs-win-probability">Total Yards vs. Win Probability</h3>

<p>We also want to see if gaining more yards contributes to a higher chance of winning. Let's create another plot for this relationship:</p>

<pre><code class="lang-r"># Visualize relationship between total yards and winning percentage
ggplot(team_summary, aes(x = total_yards, y = win)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0.05, alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "glm", method.args = list(family = "binomial"), se = FALSE, color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Total Yards vs Winning Probability",
       x = "Total Yards Gained",
       y = "Winning Percentage")</code></pre>

<p>From the above graph, we can see that gaining more yards generally increases a team's chances of winning the game, but it isn't the only determining factor. Teams need to excel in multiple areas to secure a win consistently.</p>

<br>
<h3 class="text-xl font-medium" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Our analysis shows that minimizing turnovers and gaining more total yards both contribute to a higher chance of winning NFL games. However, the relationship is not strictly linear, as other factors like defense, special teams, and in-game decisions also play a role in determining the outcome.</p>

<p>We have only scratched the surface here. By using nflfastR, more sophisticated models can be built to better predict game outcomes and understand deeper patterns within the data. If you're interested in more detailed exploration, consider incorporating EPA metrics, play success rates by situation, or advanced machine learning models to uncover even more insights.</p>


What can two decades worth of play-by-play data and some math tell us about what wins games in the NFL? Let's look at some simple linear regressions using metrics we can easily compute with nflfastR data.

We can see passing efficiency metrics have the strongest relationships with wins. Furthermore, offensive passing efficiency metrics have stronger relationships than defensive passing metrics do. 

A team's expected points added per dropback explains nearly half of the variation in their season win total. Whereas defensive expected points added per dropback explains about 32% of the variation in wins. Offensive and defensive rushing efficiency metrics only explain about 18 and 9% of the variation in wins respectively.

## Random Forest Variable Importance 
We can also build a random forest model and let the model tell us what features yield the most information gain. Again, passing efficiency is the largest driver of wins and it is not particularly close. 

```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}

```
```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}

  fit <- lm(data = df, wins ~ epa_per_pass + epa_per_rush + def_epa_per_pass + def_epa_per_rush)

  crit <- aa_critique_fit(fit)
  #crit$summary  
  #crit$residual_plot
  #crit$residual_histogram
    
# Use epa model to predict wins
  df$pred <- predict(fit, type = "response")
  df$var <- df$wins - df$pred
  
# Create variance from actual wins to pythag wins
  df$pythag_var <- df$wins - df$pythag_wins
```
```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
# See distribution of actual wins minus expected wins
  p3 <- df %>% 
    ggplot(aes(var)) +
    geom_density(color = "royal blue", size = 2) +

      title = "Distribution of Actual minus Expected Wins",
      subtitle = "Expected wins based on season EPA metrics | 1999 to 2019 Seasons",

      y = element_blank(),

    ) +
    theme(
      plot.title = element_text(size = 20,
                                hjust = 0.5,
                                face = "bold",
                                color = "black"),

## Multiple Linear Regression
We know offensive and defensive EPA per dropback metrics are useful for explaining season win totals. Just for fun make a linear regression model that uses EPA per dropback and per rush for both sides of the ball. This regression explains 78% of the variation in season wins. 

We can use the regression formula to develop expected wins based on EPA per play metrics. The distribution of actual wins minus expected wins is normally distributed with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.4 wins. 

This means 68% of the season win totals from 2009-2019 are plus or minus 1.4 wins from what our expected wins formula predicts. Furthermore, 95% of the season win totals are within 3 games of what we would predict. Put another way, it is rare for a team to out or underperform their expected wins by more than 3 games. 

```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
# The variance of actual minus expected wins seems to be normally distributed
  # What is the kurtosis?
  
#  kurtosis(df$var)
  
# Kurtosis of 2.9, normal distribution would be 3.
  # So this distribution has a little less mass in the tails as normal distribution
  
# Lets visualize the areas of tails two standard deviations away from the mean
  mean <- mean(df$var)
  sd_pos <- mean + (2 * sd(df$var))

Based on our expected wins formula the NFC North champs were predicted to have 10 wins while they actual won 13. Additionally, the team they beat to get to the NFC Championship looked more like an 8 win team rather than an 11 win team. On the other end of the spectrum the Cowboys produced EPA per play metrics that predicted an 11 win team, however, they ended up 3 wins short. 

```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
df2 <- df %>% 
  arrange(team, season) %>% 
  mutate(
    lead_wins = ifelse(season == 2019, "NA", lead(wins))
  ) %>% 
  filter(season < 2019)

df2$lead_wins <- as.double(df2$lead_wins)

df2$pred_pythag_var <- df2$pred - df2$pythag_wins
```

```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
# df2 %>% 
#   filter(var >= 2.5) %>% 
#   summarize(
#     wins = mean(wins),
#     lead_wins = mean(lead_wins),
#     variance = lead_wins - wins,
#     n = n()
#   )
```
```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
# df2 %>% 
#   filter(var <= -2.5) %>% 
#   summarize(
#     wins = mean(wins),
#     lead_wins = mean(lead_wins),
#     variance = lead_wins - wins,
#     n = n()
#   )
```
## What does this mean for the 2020 season? 
Looking at the 25 teams in the right tail (those who over performed by more than 2.5 wins) from 1999 to 2018 we find that on average their wins dropped by 2.3 games in the next season. Not great news for Packers or Seahawks fans in 2020. 

The 29 teams n the left tail we see that teams who under performed by more than 2.5 wins increased their wins by 2.7 games the next season. The 2019 Cowboys, Chargers, and Buccaneers also fall into this tail.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
# df2 %>% 
#   filter(var >= 2) %>% 
#   summarize(
#     wins = mean(wins),
#     lead_wins = mean(lead_wins),
#     variance = lead_wins - wins,
#     n = n()
#   )
```
```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
# df2 %>% 
#   filter(var <= -2) %>% 
#   summarize(
#     wins = mean(wins),
#     lead_wins = mean(lead_wins),
#     variance = lead_wins - wins,
#     n = n()
#   )
```

If we look at teams who over performed by more than 2 games (56 from 1999 to 2018) we see their wins drop on average by 2.6 games the next season. Conversely, teams who under perform by more than 2 games (50 from 1999 to 2018) increase their wins the next season by 2.6 games on average. 

## Other Findings 
The difference between actual and expected wins is largely a function of how a team performs in one score games and on special teams performance. Record in one score games isn't very stable year over year for the most part, however, a few teams did consistently out or over perform their expected wins. 

Of the 669 season long performances in the data only 38 teams under performed by more than 2.35 wins. The Chargers account for over a fifth of those seasons.
