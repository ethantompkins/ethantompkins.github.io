    <h1>Hire Me</h1>
    <h2>Contact Me</h2>
    You can email me at ethantompkins55 [at] yahoo.com
    <h2>Why Me?</h2>
    <p>
        Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at Itron developing supply chain applications in C#, C++, and Python for constructing and testing electronic devices.
        Before this, I graduated with a Computer Science degree from Clemson University, held SWE internships with Knack Works and Boeing, and was an undergraduate 
        machine learning researcher.
    </p>
    <p>
        When it comes to my technical skills, I am experienced in C#, C++, and Python along with JavaScript, React, and Vue.js. 
        I've come in contact with a lot of other programming languages, but I'm able to learn anything needed for a job.
        My free time is spent on statistics and machine learning projects, usually sports related, and the daily leetcode!
    </p>
    <h2>My Ideal Position</h2>
    <p>
        In Summer 2024, I'll be looking for full-time software engineering roles. Ideally I am looking to work remotely or in Washington, D.C.. 
        
        I am not particular about the tech stack used on the job; I'm confident I can learn any tech stack fairly quickly. 
        Ideally, my dream job would be in one of the following areas:
        <ul>
            <li>Applications of AI: LLMs, Computer Vision, etc.</li>
            <li>Finance</li>
            <li>Any SWE role at a company that's working on hard problems</li>
        </ul>
        The most important thing to me is working with a good team of people and having the opportunity to learn and grow; 
        both as a developer and as a person.
