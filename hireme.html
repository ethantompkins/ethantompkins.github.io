                    Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at Itron developing full stack applications in C#, C++, and Python for constructing and testing electronic devices.
                    Before this, I graduated with a Computer Science degree from Clemson University, held SWE interships with Knack Works and Boeing, and was an undergraduate 
                    machine learning researcher.

                    When it comes to my technical skills. I'm experienced in C#, C++, and Python along with JavaScript, React, and VueJS. 
                    I've come in contact with a lot of other programming languages, but I'll learn anything needed for the job.
